# Damm
Let's face it, who doesn't like a good damm check digit? The Damm algorithm provides
a solid scheme for generating a digit for a given sequence and checking that 
sequence with the check digit included. More details [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damm_algorithm)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```
gem 'damm'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install damm
```

## Usage


```ruby
require 'damm'

# have a number
seq = '1001004'

# add a check digit
seq << Damm.generate(seq).to_s

# sometime later, a real user keys that number in and you want to 
# sure they got it right...

# validate it
Damm.valid?(seq) # => true
```
